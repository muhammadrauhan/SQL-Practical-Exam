# SQL Practical Exam -- Sample Project
This exam is to practice SQL skills to get ready and prepare for Data Engineer certification provided by **DataCamp**. The exam covered variety of of real-world SQL tasks, focusing on data cleaning, database querying, and aggregation. 

## Overview
The exam was divided into three tasks, each assessing different SQL skills.

## Task 1 – Data Cleaning and Type Conversion
- String Manipulation:
    - Cleaned categorical and text data using functions such as TRIM(), LOWER(), UPPER(), and REPLACE().<br/>
    - Removed unwanted characters and standardized text formats.
- Data Type Conversion:
    - Used casting functions (CAST(), CONVERT()) to change values between numeric, text, and date formats.<br/>
    - Ensured compatibility for further calculations and joins.

## Task 2 – Schema Interpretation and Table Combination
- Database Schema Understanding:
    - Read and interpreted the schema to understand relationships between tables.<br/>
    - Identified primary keys, foreign keys, and data types for correct joins.
- Combining Data:
    - Used JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT) to combine data by columns.<br/>
    - Applied UNION and UNION ALL to merge data by rows where applicable.
## Task 3 – Data Aggregation
- Numeric Aggregation:
    - Calculated SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX() for numerical columns.
- Categorical Aggregation:
    - Counted distinct values and grouped results using GROUP BY.
- Date Aggregation:
    - Extracted and aggregated data based on YEAR(), MONTH(), and DAY() functions.
